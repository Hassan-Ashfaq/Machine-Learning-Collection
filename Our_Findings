In order to contribute to the repo, or build more features, 
I have implemented test cases for a two of algorithms, which are
1. KNN 
2. Logistic Regression 

Besides running the test cases as a part of the pipeline, we have also run flake8 tests, black, and pylint on the test cases files.
We have also run codeQL security analysis on Github Actions and Jenkins.

The PyLint tests fail because of certain factors such as missing docstring, not following snake-case etc.
However, we have ignored these PyLint errors and proceeded the workflow.

There are no security alerts given by CodeQL.
